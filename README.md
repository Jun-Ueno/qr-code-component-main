## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.png)

This wasn't a difficult project to code. I set the container to 320px wide and added figure and section containers. The image went inside the figure and the text goes into the section. Apply padding, colors, rounded corners, text styling and a box-shadow on the main container.

This layout is narrow enough that it doesn't require a mobile view.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The box-shadow is difficult to code just by looking at the preview. If I had the Figma or Sketch files, the parameters could be extracted, but I think my solution is good enough.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.container {
  width: 320px;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  box-shadow: 15px 8px 20px hsla(220, 15%, 55%, 25%);
}
```
